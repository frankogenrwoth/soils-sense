## 1. Functional Requirements

These define what the system should do — the core system behaviors and operations:

### User Management

- **FR1:** The system shall allow users to register and create an account.
- **FR2:** The system shall allow users to log in and log out securely.
- **FR3:** The system shall implement role-based access (e.g., Admin, Technician, Farmer).
- **FR4:** The system shall provide password reset and profile management options.

### Soil Moisture Data Handling

- **FR5:** The system shall accept soil moisture readings from IoT devices, CSV uploads, or manual input.
- **FR6:** The system shall store collected soil moisture data in a database.
- **FR7:** The system shall allow users to view a list and history of soil moisture records.
- **FR8:** The system shall allow filtering of soil moisture data by location, date range, and crop type.

### Machine Learning Integration

- **FR9:** The system shall integrate a trained ML model to predict future soil moisture levels based on historical data and weather forecasts.
- **FR10:** The system shall accept input parameters (location, current soil moisture, temperature, humidity) and return moisture level predictions.
- **FR11:** The system shall allow Admin users to upload and retrain ML models via the web interface.
- **FR12:** The system shall visualize predicted values through charts (e.g., line, bar graphs).

### Irrigation Scheduling and Recommendations

- **FR13:** The system shall provide irrigation recommendations based on soil moisture predictions and crop water requirements.
- **FR14:** The system shall send notifications or alerts (email, SMS, or in-app) when moisture levels drop below threshold values.

### Visualization and Dashboards

- **FR15:** The system shall display real-time soil moisture data in graphical dashboards.
- **FR16:** The system shall provide summary dashboards showing average moisture, daily trends, and risk warnings.

### Reporting

- **FR17:** The system shall generate periodic reports (daily, weekly, monthly) in PDF or Excel formats.
- **FR18:** The system shall allow users to download historical soil moisture and prediction reports.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

These define how the system performs — quality attributes like reliability, usability, security, and scalability:

### Performance

- **NFR1:** The system shall respond to user requests within 3 seconds for 90% of transactions.
- **NFR2:** The system shall process predictions from the ML model in under 5 seconds.

### Security

- **NFR3:** The system shall implement secure password hashing (e.g., Django’s default PBKDF2).
- **NFR4:** The system shall protect all sensitive data (user credentials, sensor data) via HTTPS.
- **NFR5:** The system shall enforce role-based access control for sensitive operations.
- **NFR6:** The system shall validate all data inputs to prevent injection attacks.

### Usability

- **NFR7:** The system shall have a responsive and user-friendly web interface accessible on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **NFR8:** The system shall provide error messages and feedback in case of invalid input or system errors.

### Availability & Reliability

- **NFR9:** The system shall have an uptime of at least 99% over any one-month period.
- **NFR10:** The system shall automatically log errors and critical system events for troubleshooting.

### Maintainability

- **NFR11:** The system codebase shall follow Django’s coding conventions for readability and maintainability.
- **NFR12:** The system shall separate ML models from application logic via APIs or a service layer.

### Scalability

- **NFR13:** The system shall support adding new sensor data sources without altering the core data model.
- **NFR14:** The system shall handle increasing volumes of data and prediction requests without degradation in performance.

### Interoperability

- **NFR15:** The system shall provide APIs to allow integration with external IoT platforms or third-party applications.
