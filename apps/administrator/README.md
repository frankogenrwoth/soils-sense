# Administrator Dashboard — Feature Plan

This document outlines the planned features for the Administrator Dashboard, based on the current TODOs and mapped directly to the requirements matrix from the project specification.

---

## TODO Items

- **User Management:**  
  - Admin should be able to manage other users on the platform (view, create, edit, delete, assign roles, reset passwords).
- **Machine Learning Model Management:**  
  - Admin should be able to upload new ML models, retrain models, and view model training history.
- **Data Management:**  
  - Admin should be able to view and manage all data on the platform (including editing and deleting records).
- **Reporting:**  
  - Admin should be able to generate reports on model performance, view logs, and download predictions.
- **Notifications & Alerts:**  
  - Admin should have access to notifications and alerts on all pages.
- **Dashboard & Visualization:**  
  - Admin should have a dashboard to view all data and analytics relevant to the admin role.
- **Sensor Management:**  
  - Admin should be able to make sensor addition requests (add new sensor data sources).

| ML Model Management         | FR11                | Upload/retrain models, monitor ML status                      |
| Data Oversight              | FR5–FR8             | View/filter/edit soil data                                    |
| Reporting & Logs            | FR17, FR18, NFR10   | Generate/download reports, view system logs                   |

| Visualization & Dashboards  | FR12, FR15, FR16    | View analytics, trends, risk warnings                         |
| System Config/Integration   | NFR13, NFR15        | Add sensors, manage API integrations                          |

**Key Requirement Codes:**  
- FR = Functional Requirement  
- NFR = Non-Functional Requirement  
(See [Requirements Specification](../../docs/requirements.md) for details.)

## Recommendations

- **Start with:** User management, data oversight, and reporting, as these are core admin functions.
- **Next:** Add ML model management and system monitoring as ML integration matures.
- **Then:** Include dashboards and visualization for a quick overview of system health and trends.
- **Finally:** Provide configuration options for notifications and integrations as needed.

If you need a prioritized or stepwise implementation plan, let me know!
